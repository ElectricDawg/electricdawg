## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dar (she/her), a student of statistics at the University of New Mexico. I code for fun and to develop my skills. Other than coding, I like to hike along the Sandia mountains and paint landscapes in my free time. If you want to reach me, my e-mail is darpoling248@outlook.com. Tell me Ember sent you.
